AirOn for Educate-Hacks

## Inspiration
*Climate change* is a _phenomenon_ where temperatures on Earth become warmer over time. Warmer temperatures disrupt weather patterns and the balance of nature overall. In the past decade, we, as a whole, have experienced the effects of climate change, then let's make a difference! I developed AirOn to provide a safe type of transportation for students without access to a vehicle, but most importantly, to *help* the Earth!

## What it does
AirOn at its core is a ridesharing app similar to Lyft and Uber, but it is much different. AirOn is completely free and only earns money through sponsorships and environmental companies. AirOn also focuses on making rides as safe as possible while combatting the issue many ridesharing apps have today, _not enough destinated drivers_.

## How I built it
I built AirOn using _Xamarin_ by Microsoft, a platform that I am very similar to!

## Challenges we ran into
I ran into many challenges with the UI and code, but my experience with _Xamarin_ helped me persevere through it all!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am very proud of the UI, and I tried to perfect it and make it as modern as possible.

## What we learned
I learned about various NuGet packages in _Xamarin_ that were built by the community to help developers like me finish tasks easily.

## What's next for AirOn
1. Create a modern, yet accessible website
2. Popularize AirOn on KickStarter and fundraiser platforms
3. Team with sponsors for better rewards
4. Team with foundations for donations
5. Make this project global, so anyone anywhere can save the air
